# DenseEdia - Progressive

I'm tired of coding this project again and again just to drop it. So this time,
it will be done bit by bit, following what I need.

I WON'T FEAR NEITHER THE REFACTORING NOR THE BREAKING CHANGES.

And maybe I'll be in peace once again.

## What is DenseEdia ?

Explaining one more, are we ? It's meant to store things. Of any kinds. With any
fields. And links between. Why not using database engine ? At this point, I
don't remember, but I have a dream, as they say.

## The next step

Let's start simple. I want the command `denseedia add [TITLE]` to add an Edium
with the title and the current date. Store it in what you want. If added, the
option `-k KIND` store the associated Edium kind.
