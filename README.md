# DenseEdia - Progressive

One more DenseEdia, one step at a time.

(This repo is the last iteration of my project DenseEdia. No further implementation will be done unless it's finished.)

## What is DenseEdia ?

DenseEdia aims to be a little database in which you can store what you want, as a graph.
Its important features are its flexibility and versioning.

All pieces of information (called Edia) will be stored at the same level. Then you can add typed Elements to them as you
wish in order to get the property structure you like. Finally, you can draw Links between two Edia.

It's provided with 3 ways to interact, in order to use it or build your own custom frontend :

- Python library
- Command line
- REST HTTP API

I'm also developing [DenseEdia-Web](https://github.com/fsabre/DenseEdia-Web), a React web frontend that uses the
provided HTTP API.

## Why do I make this ?

I wanted to have a tool that allowed me to store data about various things I liked, such as musics, games or books.

I wanted them to be interconnected like in a web, so I could link an anime to its light novel counterpart, for instance.

I wanted to be able to easily retrieve/modify the data from a script. Let's say, to make a list of my favourite musics
of 2015.

I wanted it not to depend on an external graph database engine and to be easy for the commoner to install and use.

## Concept

An Edium is the main piece of information stored in DenseEdia, hence the name.
It has a title (required) and a kind (optional).

DenseEdia stores data like in a graph, which means you can draw links between
Edia. Each link can be directed or not, and have a label (optional).

To store more information in a Edium, you can set elements. They are values with
a precise type (NONE, BOOL, INT, FLOAT, STR, DATETIME) that are stored under a
certain name in an Edium. This value is versioned, so you can retrieve a
history of an element value over time.

## Installation

Clone the project, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fsabre/DenseEdia-Progressive  # Clone the project
cd DenseEdia-Progressive/  # Move into the folder
python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Enter it
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install the dependencies ... and it's done.
```

## Usage

### Command line

#### Display the help

```bash
cd DenseEdia-Progressive/  # Move into the folder
source venv/bin/activate  # Enter the virtual environment

python -m denseedia --help  # Read the CLI documentation
python -m denseedia add-edium --help  # Read the documentation of the "add-edium" command
python -m denseedia edium --help  # Read the documentation of the "edium" group
```

You can find in the help some commands that are not presented in this README.

#### Add Edia

```bash
python -m denseedia add-edium "DenseEdia installation" -k event  # Add an event
python -m denseedia add-edium "Portal 2" -k event  # Add a game
python -m denseedia add-edium --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0pqJRUTQpY -k music  # Add a music you like
python -m denseedia add-edium "Perdu.com" --url https://www.perdu.com -k website -c "I love this website."  # Add a website with a comment
```

#### Display Edia

```bash
python -m denseedia list  # Show a list of all Edia
python -m denseedia edium 2 show  # Show the details (elements and links) of the Edium nÂ°2
```

#### Draw links

```bash
python -m denseedia add-link 3 2 --label origin  # Draw a link from the 3rd Edium to the 2nd with label "origin"
```

#### Set elements

The element names are at your liking.

```bash
python -m denseedia edium 1 set comment "This will help me in the future."  # Set the element "comment"
python -m denseedia edium 1 set rating --type int 10 # Set the element "rating" to an integer value
python -m denseedia edium 1 set rating --type float --allow-type-change 9.5  # Set the element "rating" to a float value 
```

In this last case, as a safety measure, DenseEdia won't allow you to change the
value from an integer (10) to a float value (9.5), unless the
`-y/--allow-type-change` flag is given.

### HTTP API

#### Run

Run the API server with :

```bash
python -m denseedia start-server
```

Then, an interactive docs page is available at http://localhost:59130.

## The next step

Let's create issues for new ideas. It's more convenient.
