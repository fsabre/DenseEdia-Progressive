# DenseEdia - Progressive

One more DenseEdia, one step at a time.

I'm tired of coding this project again and again just to drop it. So this time,
it will be done bit by bit, following what I need. I WON'T FEAR NEITHER THE
REFACTORING NOR THE BREAKING CHANGES. And maybe I'll be in peace once again.

## What is DenseEdia ?

Explaining one more, are we ? It's meant to store things. Of any kinds. With any
fields. And links between. Why not using database engine ? At this point, I
don't remember, but I have a dream, as they say.

## The next step

- Allow the command `denseedia add --url [URL]` to specify an URL. Optimally in
  this case, the title will be asked if missing in the command.
